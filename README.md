# AMJ latex template

## 🧐 Why use AMJ latex template
When I wrote my thesis I had to use the AMJ citation format according to these [specifications](https://aom.org/docs/default-source/publishing-with-aom/aom_journal_style_guidea3b84b773e3649569a17a05e14cc6eaf.pdf?sfvrsn=f94177b2_2). <br>
This proved to be difficult, as there was no latex template found accross the web that fit the criteria 😠. <br>
So I spend hours going back and forth to get as close as possible to the needed style, so you don't need to 😀.

This is the result, which also includes a few handy latex tricks to polish the work.
